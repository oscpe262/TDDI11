# Embedded systems
 - Special purpose
 - Part of a larger system
 - Sensors, actuators - (I/O) -, microcontroller
 
# Significance
 
# Complexity
 - Unpredictable reality
 - Functionalities resulting in concurrency
 - Connecting devices, adaptivity, autonomous and learning system ...
 
# Criticality
 - Safety (Automotive, avionics, medicine ...)
 - Reactivity (fast response time)
 - Real-time (guaranteed response time)
 - Reliability ("should just work", limited possibility to fix after shipping)
 
# Functional vs. non-functional requirements
 - Functional (output as a function of input)
 - Non-functional:
   - time req. to compute output
   - size, weight etc.
   - power consumption
   - reliability
   - etc.
  
----------
# Read-time systems
 - correctness depens on log. results of comp., but also the time at which they are produced
 - Hard vs. soft real time - missing deadline causes failure (h) or degraded perf (s)
 - Not necessarily embedded and vice versa
